# Fashion Recommender System

## Overview
This project implements a synthetic simulation of a fashion recommendation system. It leverages pretrained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) from PyTorchâ€™s torchvision (including ResNet50, DenseNet121, and VGG16) to extract feature vectors from fashion item images. By parsing image filenames with a regular expression, the system extracts metadata (such as gender, category, and item ID) and builds a dataset of items. In addition, synthetic purchase data is generated to simulate customer behavior, which is then used to compute recommendations based on a fused relevance score.

## Key Features
- **Image Feature Extraction:**  
  Uses pretrained models (ResNet50, DenseNet121, VGG16) to extract image features. The final classification layers are replaced with identity mappings (or trimmed) to output feature vectors.
  
- **Metadata Extraction:**  
  Extracts metadata (gender, category, item ID, etc.) from image filenames using a regular expression.

- **Synthetic Purchase Data Generation:**  
  Simulates purchase histories for a configurable number of customers. Purchase events consider trendy preferences, item popularity, and category preferences over a defined date range.

- **Recommender System:**  
  For each purchased item, the system computes a fused "Relevance" score for candidate items. The score is a weighted combination of:
  - Visual similarity (cosine similarity between feature vectors)
  - Item popularity (updated with each synthetic purchase)
  - Gender match (binary indicator)
  - Category similarity (based on a manual similarity matrix with groupings)
  
  The system then outputs the top-K recommended items for each purchased item, along with store details and the distance from the user (calculated using the Haversine formula).

- **Store and User Location Simulation:**  
  Items are assigned to one of several stores with randomly generated geo-coordinates. A random user location is also generated to simulate the geographical aspect of recommendations.

## Project Structure
- **Feature Extraction & Caching:**  
  Extracts image features and caches them to disk. The metadata is similarly cached, allowing for faster subsequent runs.
  
- **Synthetic Data Generation:**  
  Generates synthetic purchase data that includes purchase date, customer ID, item ID, and associated metadata.
  
- **Recommendation Calculation:**  
  Calculates a fused relevance score for candidate items that are not yet purchased by a user. The recommendations take into account visual similarity, popularity, gender matching, and category similarity.


## Customization
- **Backbone Models:**  
Experiment with different CNN backbones by adding or modifying the entries in the `backbones` list.

- **Parameters:**
Adjust simulation parameters such as the number of customers, maximum purchases per customer, and top-K recommendations.

- **Category Similarity:**
Modify the manual similarity matrix and category groupings to suit different fashion item categorizations or business requirements.
